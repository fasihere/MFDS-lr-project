# MFDS-logistic-regression-project
This is a data science project done in a team of six. I specifically worked on question 2, i.e. the logistic regression part as a smaller team of two, but was aware of the other parts involved in the project too. This project was done for the completion of a course called "Mathematical Foundations of Data Science"
